        before my time on the internet, back before search engines were even a
        thing, people used to list links to fun or useful websites right on
        their personal webpages. recently, i stumbled upon
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com">Aaron Strick's website</a></mark
        >, and he has something similar that he calls an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">“outbound”</a></mark>
        page. i want to have my own version and i call it the “explore” page
        (just to make things more confusing, he also has an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">"explore"</a></mark>
        page, but his is more like a personal blog). on this page, i'll be
        sharing content i find interesting, inspiring, fun, or just stuff that
        feels like it belongs here. fair warning: this page probably won't be as
        visually polished or tightly managed as the rest of the site. i might
        end up using this as a bit of a playground, and the content here will
        likely get updated frequently.

          i've always been fascinated by the history of operating systems, web
          browsers, the internet and everything surrounding them. in my spare
          time, i spend a lot of time researching these topics. since i work at
          opera, i've also gathered extensive knowledge about the company, its
          products and its history. this project is my ongoing effort to bring
          all that information together in one place. the timeline may not be
          perfectly accurate, but each topic will be listed under the year it
          was first introduced.

                in "As We May Think", an essay by Vannevar Bush which, to some
                extent, predicted many kinds of technologies invented after its
                publication (including hypertext, personal computers and the
                World Wide Web). the essay describes a memex as an
                electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and
                read a large self-contained research library, create and follow
                associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall
                these trails at any time to share them with other researchers.
