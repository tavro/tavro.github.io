        before my time on the internet, back before search engines were even a
        thing, people used to list links to fun or useful websites right on
        their personal webpages. recently, i stumbled upon
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com">Aaron Strick's website</a></mark
        >, and he has something similar that he calls an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">“outbound”</a></mark>
        page. i want to have my own version and i call it the “explore” page
        (just to make things more confusing, he also has an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">"explore"</a></mark>
        page, but his is more like a personal blog). on this page, i'll be
        sharing links to things i find interesting, inspiring, fun, or just
        stuff that feels like it belongs here. fair warning: this page probably
        won't be as visually polished or tightly managed as the rest of the
        site. i might end up using this as a bit of a playground, and the
        content here will likely get updated frequently.

              <p>
              WorldWideWeb was the first web browser (or browser-editor rather),
              when it was written in 1990 (dated 901225 although it was finished
              some time before that) it was the only way to see the web. it was
              renamed Nexus in order avoid confusion between the program and the
              abstract information space (now known as World Wide Web). it would
              browse http: space and news: and ftp: spaces and local file: space,
              but edit only in file: space as HTTP PUT was not implemented back
              then.
            </p>
            <p>
              the program was written using a NeXT computer in objective-c. it had
              the advantage that there were some great tools available. in fact,
              you could do in a couple of months what would take more like a year
              on other platforms. for instance, there was an application builder
              to make all the menus as quickly as you could dream them up.
