      <p>
        before my time on the internet, back before search engines were even a
        thing, people used to list links to fun or useful websites right on
        their personal webpages. recently, i stumbled upon
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com">Aaron Strick's website</a></mark
        >, and he has something similar that he calls an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">“outbound”</a></mark>
        page. i want to have my own version and i call it the “explore” page
        (just to make things more confusing, he also has an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">"explore"</a></mark>
        page, but his is more like a personal blog). on this page, i'll be
        sharing links to things i find interesting, inspiring, fun, or just
        stuff that feels like it belongs here. fair warning: this page probably
        won't be as visually polished or tightly managed as the rest of the
        site. i might end up using this as a bit of a playground, and the
        content here will likely get updated frequently.
