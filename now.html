        my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing
        details with family and friends. i thought this would be a great way to

        <p>
          when it comes to my personal life, i recently spent a casual long
          weekend in stockholms sk√§rg√•rd with eight of my friends. it was a lot
          of fun but spending several days with that many people can be a bit
          socially exhausting. so it didn't really feel like i had a proper
          weekend, but i'm not complaining, i loved it! i've also started
          thinking about dating more actively now that i have more spare time.
          this has made me realize just how inconvenient my apartment is. it's
          very small, has no storage space, no dishwasher, and my neighbors can
          see straight into it if i don't keep the blinds down, which i don't
          want to do, because i want light! also, i'm not sure if i've mentioned
          this here before, but the laundry booking system is terrible. you can
          only reserve one or two hours at a time, which just isn't enough to
          get everything done. so, i've been thinking about moving again, for
          the 26th time! (i'll have to double-check the exact number sometime,
          but it's definitely over 20, haha.) hopefully, the next move will be
          one of the last. i've also started taking driving lessons and am
          aiming to get my driver's license before the end of the year.

        a lot of people at my office are currently on vacation, so the workload
        has definitely gone up. with fewer people around there are naturally
        more tasks per person in the backlog for the current milestone. i
        actually like it, though, because it means there are more tasks to
        choose from. i've been working on some larger features this month, which
        is fun, i'm looking forward to seeing them go live in production! the
        summer intern i'm responsible for has finished one of his two projects,
        and i'm excited to see what he'll come up with for the second one. it's
        going to be a spotify wrapped-inspired project, but for our product. i'm
        also trying to refer a skilled friend of mine for a position at my
        office, we'll see how that turns out! :-)

        i don't have much of an update at the moment, except that we're
        currently at a meetup, a ‚Äúteam building event‚Äù though it's really more
        of a casual hangout. also, two other companies has reached out to us
        expressing interest in a potential collaboration. i'll probably be able
        to share more details about that publicly next month.
      </p>
      <h3>LiTHanian</h3>
      <p>
        i don't have much of an update on LiTHanian either, except that our
        latest magazine is currently being printed and sent out to our readers.
        we're also in the process of planning the handover to the new editorial
        team.

      <p>
        i started my now page approximately one year ago, and i wanted to do
        something special to celebrate it, so i rewrote my entire now page from
        scratch, and this sparked some motivation to rewrite my entire website.
        so that is what i've been doing as a hobby project lately. before it was
        written in react, but i found it tedious to keep things updated, and the
        code was horrible anyways. i want something that's easy to maintain and
        update, and something that can be hosted statically, essentially
        anywhere. so i decided to limit myself to html, css and javascript. this
        change also includes migrating my old digital resume and blog. the
        resume was easy enough, but the blog has been entirely restrucutred,
        tech wise. you can read more about my blog

        <p>
          i have been taking a lot of "professional" pictures lately, i've
          gathered hundreds of reference photos and been planning photos in
          detail. but it's super hard to match my vision, so most of the photos,
          turned out like crap, in my opinion. since they will be included in my
          book, i won't be sharing them on here, just yet. they need context to
          be enjoyed.

        i have spent very little time making music lately, i don't have much of
        an update. but i have experimented with strudel, it seems like something
        for me. at some point i'm going to write a ui wrapper around it to suit
        my needs better. that is it, when it comes to music.

          can measure and keep track of, but other times it feels different
          depending on how you experience it. they share stories from their own
          lives to show how time doesn't always feel like a straight line and
          how memories and moments can change how we think about it.
