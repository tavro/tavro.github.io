              i've been curious about switching to vim, since many of my friends
              use it. but i learned to use emacs in university, and my
              procedural memory has kept me from making the switch. i'm
              currently building my own editor, so i'll probably end up using
              that, if it ever gets finished that is...!

        before my time on the internet, back before search engines were even a
        thing, people used to list links to fun or useful websites right on
        their personal webpages. recently, i stumbled upon
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com">Aaron Strick's website</a></mark
        >, and he has something similar that he calls an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">“outbound”</a></mark>
        page. i want to have my own version and i call it the “explore” page
        (just to make things more confusing, he also has an
        <mark><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/outbound">"explore"</a></mark>
        page, but his is more like a personal blog). on this page, i'll be
        sharing links to things i find interesting, inspiring, fun, or just
        stuff that feels like it belongs here. fair warning: this page probably
        won't be as visually polished or tightly managed as the rest of the
        site. i might end up using this as a bit of a playground, and the
        content here will likely get updated frequently.

      <p>
        my navigation bar became too crowded and looked terrible on mobile
        devices. so instead i'll list additional pages on my website here while
        i work on a new navigation bar design that i'm happy with. i know this
        is crappy, but please bear with me.
