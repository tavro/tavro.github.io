            my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing

                this month has been pretty tough. i‚Äôve been dealing with what i believe are stress-related health issues, and they‚Äôve become quite serious. i‚Äôve experienced stroke-like symptoms and even had to call an ambulance at one point. these issues have been ongoing for about half a year now, but they‚Äôve never felt this severe before. i‚Äôm now in contact with my hospital regarding this. if i had to guess, i‚Äôd say it might be because all of my engagements have started up again after the summer. that said, things have been improving towards the end of the month. last month, i mentioned that i was thinking about moving, and now i‚Äôve actually taken the first step, i found an apartment closer to the city center and sent in my application, hopefully, i‚Äôll get it! if so i'll move in early december. it‚Äôs in the same price range as my current place, but a little bigger and it even has a dishwasher, haha. as i‚Äôm writing this, i‚Äôm on my way home from oslo, norway. it was my first time there, and i went just to relax and take some time for myself. it was totally worth it, although i have to say oslo is extremely expensive. for example, i couldn‚Äôt find a single bar selling beer for under 110 SEK. i guess it‚Äôs the same in stockholm and other big cities, though, i‚Äôm not sure. i think i mentioned this last month (or the month before), but i‚Äôm also working on getting my driver‚Äôs license. i have five more driving lessons left before i attempt the final test.

            <p>
            things at opera are really exciting right now! i‚Äôm not sure how much i‚Äôm allowed to share at the moment, but i can say that a lot is happening both around the app i‚Äôm working on and at opera as a whole. this year marks opera‚Äôs 30th anniversary, and there‚Äôs a big internal event planned to celebrate. our app will also be mentioned in the upcoming quarterly report, which is a good sign, i think. on top of that, we‚Äôre hiring new employees, and i‚Äôm currently in the process of referring my second friend to interview for a role. in a month or two, i‚Äôll probably be able to talk more about what i‚Äôve found so exciting this month, so stay tuned!

            <h3>LiTHe Hax</h3>
            <p>
            LiTHe Hax is back after a short summer break, and more active than ever! we were recently contacted by IEEE, who want to collaborate with us. the plan is to organize a large ctf in november, specifically aimed at women and high school students. to make this happen, we‚Äôre expanding our organization and creating what we call the ‚Äúctf committee.‚Äù if you‚Äôre interested in joining, just send me an email! in addition to this, we‚Äôll also be hosting a mini ctf at goto 10 tomorrow, together with foo caf√©, who will provide food and drinks. the plan is to play PicoCTF with our members, if they show up ;-P we‚Äôve also been attending lots of meetings lately, exploring potential sponsorships for upcoming events. on top of that, we painted our logo on m√§rkesbacken at link√∂ping university, as you can see below in the photography section.
            </p>
            <h3>LiTHanian</h3>
            <p>
            our last issue has finally reached our members mailboxes, which also means recruiting for the new editorial team has begun. this will be a historic year for LiTHanian, as we will no longer be able to send out our first issue to all students at the faculty of science and engineering. this means we‚Äôll need to find creative new ways to market the magazine. the plan is to focus more on digital solutions this year, with the hope of reaching a wider audience. we‚Äôll see how it develops. as for LiTHe Hax, i also painted the logo on M√§rkesbacken. aside from that, there isn‚Äôt much more to update at the moment, since i don‚Äôt yet have a new editorial team in place just yet.

            <p>
            since i got my glove80s, development has been a bit slow, haha. i‚Äôve mainly been working on two projects. the first one is "jakel", my custom-built text editor. i started it mostly for fun and to learn, but i‚Äôve actually been using it for real development work. i‚Äôve been gradually adding features i need along the way. it‚Äôs written in C, and it‚Äôs been really enjoyable to dive back into C programming, i actually really like the language. the second project is "BEM", my own browser engine. i‚Äôve been spending some time researching how browsers work, which seemed like a good idea since i work at a browser company, lol. just like with jakel, i‚Äôm mainly doing it as a learning project. right now, i‚Äôm in the process of rewriting the html parser, since my first attempt wasn‚Äôt very good.

            i haven‚Äôt been making any music lately, but i‚Äôve been listening to a lot of it. that was actually the main thing i did while in oslo, walking in nature with music in my headphones, going to the bob hund concert, and visiting different bars with live music. it was a lot of fun. i really enjoy discovering new bands and lesser known artists. one highlight was a norwegian band called "Drak√•nis", who opened for bob hund. they were super cool and have a lot of potential, so i‚Äôve started following them on spotify.
