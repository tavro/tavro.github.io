              for film photography, i'm using a canon eos 500 that i found in a
              second-hand store. the nikon coolpix p510 is my main camera, it
              has a really nice optical zoom, which you won't find in any
              smartphone, for example. i like this because you can take good
              photos from afar, and for people interested in birds, like me,
              it's a great feature. for more casual photos, i use a oneplus
              phone dedicated solely to photography.
