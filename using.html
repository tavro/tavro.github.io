              use it. but i learned to use emacs in university, and my
              procedural memory has kept me from making the switch. i'm
              currently building my own editor, so i'll probably end up using
              that, if it ever gets finished that is...!

              motorola for less than $90.

              for film photography, i'm using a canon eos 500 that i found in a
              second-hand store. the nikon coolpix p510 is my main camera, it
              has a really nice optical zoom, which you won't find in any
              smartphone, for example. i like this because you can take good
              photos from afar, and for people interested in birds, like me,
              it's a great feature. for more casual photos, i use a oneplus
              phone dedicated solely to photography.
